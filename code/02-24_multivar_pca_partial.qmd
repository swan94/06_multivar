# Learning objectives  
Our learning objectives are to:  

  - Explore what is and when to use multivariate analysis  
  - Explore different types of multivariate analysis  
  - Import our feature-engineered weather data set to be analyzed  
  - Understand what is multicollinearity, its effects, implications, and remedies   
  - Run principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction  

# Introduction  
## Terminology  

In the following general equation:  

    y ~ x

Y is normally referred to as:  
  - Response variable  
  - Dependent variable  
  - Predicted variable  

X is normally referred to as:  
  - Explanatory variable  
  - Independent variable  
  - Predictor variable  

## What is multivariate analysis?  

Most common: multiple Xs (predictors)  

               y ~ x1 + x2 + .... xn  
               yield ~ precip + temp + som + hybrid  
    
Perhaps multiple Xs (predictors) without a Y (outcome)  

              ~ x1 + x2 + .... xn

While some can have multiple Ys (outcomes)  

               y1 + y2 ~ x1 + x2 (MANOVA)  
               yield + biomass ~ precip + temp  
  
## When to use multivariate?  
When multiple predictors can be used to explain an outcome.  

When multiple predictors can be used to create data-driven groups (clusters).  

Commonly not a "designed experiment" analysis, but an exploratory relationship approach.  

## Main types of multivariate  
- Dimensionality reduction  
    - **Principal component analysis (PCA)**  
    - Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA)  
    - Factor analysis  
    
- Clustering 
    - **k-means**, c-means, x-means  
    - Non-numerical multidimensional scaling  
    - nearest neighbor  
  
- Relationship between variables / Prediction  
  - Multiple linear regression/stepwise regression  
  - **Random forest**    
  - **Conditional inference tree**  

## A few ways to characterize multivariate analysis  
- Based on analysis goal:  

  - Decrease number of dimensions  
  - Create clusters  
  - Establish significant relationships among multiple predictors and an outcome.  

- Based on Y (outcome) existence:
    - Supervised  
    - Unsupervised  

- If Y exists, based on its type:  
    - Categorical: classification  
    - Numerical: regression  

# Setup

```

```{r}
weather <- read.csv("../data/weather_monthsum.csv")

weather
```


# EDA  
How are variables related? Any strong correlations that we should watch out for?  

Let's create a correlation matrix
```{r correlation matrix p-values}
# Estimating significance matrix
p.mat <- weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-year, -site) %>%
  cor_pmat()

p.mat
```

Plotting  
```{r correlation matrix plot}
weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-year, -site) %>%
  cor() %>%
  ggcorrplot(hc.order = TRUE, 
             digits = 1,
             type = "lower", 
             p.mat = p.mat, 
             sig.level = 0.05,
             insig = "blank",
             lab = TRUE)

ggsave("../output/corrmat.png",
       height = 25,
       width = 22,
       bg = "white")
```

A bit difficult to see because we have so many predictors, let's extract in table format.  

```{r highest correlations}
weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-year, -site) %>%
  cor() %>% # calculates r (-1 to 1)
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -rowname) %>%
  filter(abs(value) > .85 & value != 1) %>%
  arrange(desc(value)) %>%
  distinct(value, .keep_all = T)

```

```{r lowest correlations}
weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-year, -site) %>%
  cor() %>% # calculates r (-1 to 1)
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -rowname) %>%
  filter(abs(value) < .05 & value != 1) %>%
  arrange(abs(value)) %>%
  distinct(value, .keep_all = T)

```

How do variables relate to fiber strength in a bivariate relationship?  

```{r r2}
weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-site, -year) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=-strength_gtex) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(r2 = map_dbl(data,
                  ~lm(strength_gtex ~ value,
                      data = .x) %>%
                    glance(.) %>%
                    pull(r.squared)
                  )) %>%
  arrange(desc(r2))


```

```{r r2 plot}
weather %>%
  dplyr::select(-site, -year) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=-strength_gtex) %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(r2 = map_dbl(data,
                  ~lm(strength_gtex ~ value,
                      data = .x) %>%
                    glance(.) %>%
                    pull(r.squared)
                  )) %>%
  arrange(desc(r2)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice(1:6) %>% 
  unnest(data) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, 
             y = strength_gtex))+
  geom_point(shape = 21, 
             alpha = .7, 
             fill = "purple")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = F, 
              color = "black", 
              size = 1)+
  facet_wrap(~name, 
             scales = "free_x", 
             ncol=2) 

```

# Multicollinearity 
## Concepts  
Multicollinearity definition: more than two explanatory variables in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related.  


Multicollinearity is an issue because:  

- Model estimates magnitude and direction (+ or -) can change for multicollinear variables compared to a non-multicollinear model.  
  
- Model estimates standard error are inflated, directly affecting p-values, estimate significance, and power.  
  

## Applied example  
Let's select a few variables to run some tests.  
Two uncorrelated variables:
```{r uncorrelated}
weather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_dayl.s_Apr, 
             y = sum_prcp.mm_Oct)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  stat_correlation()
```

Two correlated variables:
```{r correlated}
weather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_dayl.s_Apr, 
             y = mean_dayl.s_May))+
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm")

```

Now let's fit some models with one or two uncorrelated and correlated variables explaining fiberstrength and see what happens.  

```{r strength ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr}
lm_dayl.apr 

lm_dayl.apr

```

```{r strength ~ sum_prcp.mm_Oct}
lm_prp.oct <- lm(strength_gtex ~ sum_prcp.mm_Oct,
   data = weather) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  filter(term!="(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(mod="lm_prp.oct")

lm_prp.oct
```

```{r strength ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr + sum_prcp.mm_Oct}
lm_dayl.prcp <- lm(strength_gtex ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr + 
                   sum_prcp.mm_Oct,
   data = weather) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(mod = "lm_2var.uncor")

lm_dayl.prcp

```

```{r strength ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr + mean_dayl.s_May}
lm_daylapr.daylmay <- lm(strength_gtex ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr + 
                  mean_dayl.s_May,
   data = weather) %>%
  tidy() %>%
  filter(term!="(Intercept)") %>%
  mutate(mod="lm_2var.cor")

lm_daylapr.daylmay

```

```{r Checking multicollinearity}
lm_dayl.apr %>%
  bind_rows(lm_prp.oct, 
            lm_dayl.prcp,
            lm_daylapr.daylmay) %>%
  mutate(mod=factor(mod,
                    levels=c("lm_dayl.apr",
                             "lm_prp.oct",
                             "lm_2var.uncor",
                             "lm_2var.cor"))) %>%
  filter(term != "mean_dayl.s_May") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mod))

```

What has happened with **mean_dayl.s_April** and **sum_prcp.mm_Oct** estimates and standard error when modeled i) alone, or with another uncorrelated variable vs. ii) with another correlated variable?

One way to check the degree of multicollinearity between two predictos is with the variance inflation factor (VIF).  

VIF values range from 1 to positive infinite.  
General rule of thumb:  

- VIF ~ 1: no multicollinearity  
- VIF between 1 and 5: moderate multicollinearity  
- VIF > 5: severe multicollinearity  

Let's check the variance inflation factor (VIF) of both uncorrelated and correlated models
```{r vif uncorrelated}
# Uncorrelated
```


```{r vif correlated}
# Correlated
lm(strength_gtex ~ mean_dayl.s_Apr + 
                  mean_dayl.s_May,
   data = weather) %>%
  vif()

```

## Dealing with multicollinearity  
So what now?  
How can we deal with correlated variables in a multivariate approach?  
Options:  

- Dimensionality reduction  
    - By hand (selecting predictors based on previous knowledge, literature, etc.)  
    - By math  
  
- Algorithm that handles multicollinearity  
    - Variable selection    
    - Multivariate by ensembling multiple bivariates   

Many multivariate approaches deal with some sort of similarity/dissimilarity measure among predictors.  

In those cases, predictors with vastly different scales (e.g. mean_tmin.c_Jan from -10 to 10 C vs mean_dayl.s_Jul from 48000 to 51000) need to be normalized so measurement scale does not affect variable importance.    

Thus, our numerical predictor variables need to be normalized (center and scale) before starting our multivariate analysis.  

Some analysis do the normalization for you (like PCA), and others don't (like k-means), so need to be aware of this to ensure data is normalized.  

Since both PCA and k-means only take numerical variables, let's select them now.  
```{r selecting only numerical vars}
weather_n 

weather_n
```

# PCA  
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction approach that accomodates only numerical variables.  

Finds linear relationships among predictors that can be represented in a lower number of uncorrelated dimensions.  

Works well when at least some predictors are correlated.  

PCA:  

- Is used for dimensionality reduction  
- Is an unsupervised analysis (no outcome)  
- Only takes predictors  
- Predictors need to be numerical  

Some PCA properties:  

- The number of PCs calculated is the same as the number of variables in the data set (e.g., in our case, 72).  

- The overall variance explained by each PC is greatest for PC1 and decreases as PC number increases (e.g., PC72 will explain the least variance).  

- All PCs are **orthogonal** (i.e., independent of each other).  

- The goal is to select a small number of PCs that explain a minimum threshold of the total variance (e.g., 70%).  

```{r pca in action}
knitr::include_graphics("https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*V4H3Cu8qGr_90WANKSO9BA.gif")
```
Let's run PCA for our weather data.  

```{r pca model}
mod_pca 

```

## Choosing number of PCs  
Based on scree plot (total variance):  
```{r pca checking number of components}
# Scree plot

```
    
PCs 1 and 2 explain ~35% and ~26% (61%) of total variance.
This indicates that original variables were correlated (as we expected).   

If wanted to use enough PCs to explain 70% of total variance, how many would we need?  
```{r PCs to explain 70pct variance}


```
    
We would need 4 PCs.  
Normally we wish to use 2-3 PCs, but 4 is certainly better than 72 original variables.  

## Inspecting PCs  
Let's inspect PC1 through the loadings (weights) of each variable towards it.  

What are the weights that each variable received in this PC?  
```{r PC1 weights}
mod_pca$rotation %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "var") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(var,desc(PC1)), 
             y = PC1))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
           aes(fill = PC1), 
           show.legend = F)+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
                                   hjust = 1))

```

Which variables contributed most to PC1, regardless of direction?  

```{r variables contributing to PC1}

```
  
Let's check the eigenvectors for both PCs 1 and 2 variables:  

```{r pca variable contribution }
fviz_pca_var(mod_pca, 
             col.var = "contrib", # Color by contributions to the PC
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE     # Avoid text overlapping
             )

```
  
The longer is the eigenvector for a given variable, the more important it is towards that PC.  

Let's plot PC1 vs PC2 scores, look for any groupings.  

```{r PC1 vs PC2}

```
  
Appears that some groups exist.  


What did we learn?  

- Some original variables strongly correlated  
- Need at least 4 PCs to cover ~70% of original variables variance  
- Most important variables in PC1 were related to day length in winter and summer months.  

What now?  
Let's add the first 4 PCs to our original dataset and run a regression versus grain yield.    

```{r pca scores}
# Extract first 4 PCs scores
pca_scores 

pca_scores
```

```{r pca regression}
# Adding PCs 1-4 scores to original data set
weather_postpca 

# Regression of yield ~ PCs

lm_pca 

# Summary  
summary(lm_pca)
```


```{r pca regression}
# Checking VIF

```

```{r pca regression plots}
# Plotting strength vs PC1

```


```{r pca regression plots}
# Plotting strength vs PC2
ggplot(weather_postpca, 
       aes(x = PC2, y = strength_gtex))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

```{r pca regression plots}
# Plotting strength vs PC3
ggplot(weather_postpca, 
       aes(x = PC3, y = strength_gtex))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

Only PCs 2 and 3 explained strength (look at which variables were most important to each PC for interpretation).  

As expected, PCs were not multicollinear (VIF=1).  

# Summary

  - How multicollinearity is an issue and what to do to fix it   
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction
